Kasa, a web developer from Taiwan who juggles Ruby, TypeScript, and a bit of Python, currently works at a university ‚Äî not as a lecturer or a researcher, but as an everyday engineer focusing on an e-learning system.

In May 2025, she became better known in the community as ‚Äúthe Taiwanese girl who got inspired at the [RubyKaigi Code Party](https://github.com/andpad-dev/code-party/tree/main/rubykaigi-2025) and [wrote a ÁÑ°Èôê„Çø„É´„Éà TRICK](https://x.com/k_hno3/status/1917560808164450741)‚Äù ‚Äî although she‚Äôs already eager to craft a newer, more advanced [TRICK](https://github.com/tric) for [RubyConf Taiwan](https://2025.rubyconf.tw/).

Her favorite Ruby syntax is inheritance: `class Kasa < Hsiao` ‚Äî something about its conciseness and wit that soothes her inner chaos.
