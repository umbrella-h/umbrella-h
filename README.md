Kasa, a web developer from Taiwan who juggles Ruby, TypeScript, Python, and a bit of DevOps, currently works at a university—not as a lecturer or a researcher, but as an everyday engineer focusing on an e-learning system.

In May 2025, she became better known in the community as "the Taiwanese girl who got inspired at the [RubyKaigi Code Party](https://github.com/andpad-dev/code-party/tree/main/rubykaigi-2025) and [wrote a "無限タルト TRICK"](https://x.com/k_hno3/status/1917560808164450741)" —although she's already eager to craft a newer, more advanced [TRICK](https://github.com/tric), ["With Ruby, We Stride"](https://x.com/k_hno3/status/1950498958197039264), for [RubyConf Taiwan](https://2025.rubyconf.tw/).

Her favorite Ruby syntax is inheritance: `class Kasa < Hsiao` —something about its conciseness and wit that soothes her inner chaos.
